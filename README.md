# numbers

Implementation of several number types.

## To-Dos

* dynamic integers (with optimization for small integers - keep them on stack)
* fixed size integers
* fixed size integers changing to dynamic after owerflow
* rational numbers
* several floating point types
    * float with custom mantisa and exponent size
    * partialy dynamic floats, with either dynamic mantisa or dynamic exponent
    * completely dynamic float
* Zn numbers
